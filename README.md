# json-diff

A CLI tool to produce **structural diff** of two JSON files

## Usage

    $ java -jar json-diff.jar [-m {visual|patch}] file1.json file2.json

`-m` or `--mode` lets you choose output format.

`visual` prints **all** JSON, marking difference in-place. It's made with [deep-diff2](https://github.com/lambdaisland/deep-diff2).

`patch` prints the minimal necessary changes needed to make file2 from file1. It's made with [editscript](https://github.com/juji-io/editscript).
